# BRDT_QE2020

## About
This is a demo to demonstrate the work of optimal binomial reliabiltiy demonstration test (BRDT) designs, from one of the research projects listed in [Suiyao Chen's Homepage](https://sites.google.com/mail.usf.edu/suiyaochen-professional/publication?authuser=0). The related paper is "Optimal Binomial Reliability Demonstration Tests Design Under Acceptance Decision Uncertainty". The related presentation slides are "Optimal Design Of Reliability Demonstration Tests With Risk-adjusted Costs".



## Instructions
The RDT design is based on Monte Carlo Simulation.

## [R Package](Rpackage)
[BRDT](https://github.com/ericchen12377/BRDT) is the related R package for the project.
